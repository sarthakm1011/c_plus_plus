// Global variables are shared but stack variables are not shared
// Questions?
// 1) what is the memory model?
// 2) How are instances of variables mapped to memory?
// 3) How many threads might be referenced to those instances? 


// Thread: 
// Conceptually: Each thread has it's own stack, stack pointer, condition codes, registers
// Operationally: Threads share the address hence they can acces the stacks and stack pointer of other threads practically
